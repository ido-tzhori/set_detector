## Description

This project aims to solve the card game SET in real time. SET is a challenging game that tests players' visual perception and pattern recognition skills. Players must identify sets of three cards where each characteristic - color, number, shading, and shape - either all match or are all different. Built with python, it leverages opencv to classify each card and calculate the sets of a game.
